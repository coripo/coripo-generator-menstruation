## Coripo Generators
Coripo supports generators as a way to create sophisticated and predictable chained events as one event data-wise. Every event can have multiple types of repeats at the same time and multiple sequels. The interesting thing is that sequels can own repeats, too.

## Menstruation Event Generator
Menstruation, also known as a period or monthly, is almost predictable therefore as a probable need, Menstruation Event Generator has been developed as a plugin for Coripo Calendar. 

## Notice
This package should be used as a plugin for coripo-api and has no applicability alone on it's own.
